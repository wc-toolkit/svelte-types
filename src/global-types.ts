/**
 * Default DOM event handlers that can be included in custom elements.
 *
 * These event handlers can be included in generated Svelte component types.
 * Use the `includeDefaultDOMEvents` option to automatically include these event handlers
 * in all your custom element definitions. This provides a more native-like developer
 * experience when working with your components in Svelte.
 *
 * By default, this option is set to `false` to keep the type definitions lean.
 * Set it to `true` to include all these events in your element definitions.
 *
 * Example configuration:
 * ```ts
 * {
 *   includeDefaultDOMEvents: true
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * This can be used alongside `globalEvents` for additional custom events.
